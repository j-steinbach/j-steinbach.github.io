# I am Jonas. And this is my website


I intend it to be a point of contact and professional reference page, but also a platform to share my writings, blog posts and paintings.

## About me

I am a master of computer science from Germany, love colors and design, almost finished a PhD in Belgium (on halt), and spend my free time on learning, painting, writing, dancing, cooking and traveling. Oh, and I also love pizza and swans!


## Credentials

See my Curriculum vitae, or contact me. I speak German, English, and some Dutch, French and Turkish.

## Art 

I post random abstract drawings on Instagram. But you can also find a compilation here. I do this for fun and to relax, but at least one stranger wanted to know if they can buy a print :)

## Writings

Below you can find an unordered list of my latest writings, musings, blog posts and thoughts. It's a bit random, but hey-- I'm an artist!

Isn't it awesome? Bold colors, cool fonts, and interesting content.
