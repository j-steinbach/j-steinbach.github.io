_Cheap, fast, simple, and sometimes even delicious._

I really have no idea what I am doing, so adapt the timings and amount of ingredients based on your feelings. 
I cook by heart, not by measurements.

OPT = Optional, if you have it

ALT = Alternatively, often used as experiment :)

All dishes are 2 servings.

## General Advice

- Get a rice cooker. Perfectly cooked rice, bulgur, noodles, ... every single day without wasting brain power? Hell yeah!
- If you live alone, cook two portions and eat the leftovers the next day
- Don't be afraid to buy cheap random produce in the super market, then mix it into recipes over the next days
- If you encounter a new vegetable, look up how the pros prepare (cut) it. This will save a lot of time
  - Definitely do this for the vegetables you use the most often; onions, bell peppers, courgette
- Courgette fits into any food :)
- The five basic tastes are: sweet, sour, bitter, salty and [Umami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umami). Ideally your food contains all of them
- Buy the canned Italian ones that are whole but without skin. Best flavor, least work, also 50ct for 400g
  - Mix with the small ones (Datterino, cherry). Half them where they connected to the strubbery, that is the easiest point to cut 


## Noudle Soup

What to bring

```
- Cooking oil
- Garlic, Ginger, OPT Fennel seeds
- Some paste; Thai-Curry, Sambal Olek, Harissa, Soy sauce...
- Vegetables: carrots, celery, spring onions, spinach leaves, small tomatoes, bok choy, mushrooms, bell pepper, sprouts, cabbage, canned corn...
  - I recommend spring onion, carrots, celery, spinach leaves, and some small tomatoes and canned corn

```

How to make

1. In a pot heat cooking oil and OPT fennel seeds and chilies
2. Add some garlic and ginger for 2 min, until fragrant.

4. Add vegetables, stir-fry them for 1 min.
6. OPT: Add a fried egg (apparently Chinese style)
5. Add water, mix in vegetable soup powder, boil.
7. Serve with noodles. ALT The noodles usually cook in 3 min, so I just add a chunk of them into my bowl, wait for them to get ready, then ravish them :)

Tip: Slice some small red chilies, watch them float menacingly in the oily soup!
