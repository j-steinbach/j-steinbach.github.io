## You are they buyer, not the seller

If someone gets mad at you, they make an offer. You can decide to get angry or sad, or you can just look at them, choose to not buy, and literally don't care about their bullshit.

## Always dress as if you were to go out.

Shower, deo, parfum, clean clothes. When you unexpectedly meet people, you are already ready.

## Always have your apartment in a state that you can invite people over

'Hey, let's grab a coffee at your place? <3' 'Err, I haven't cleaned the bathroom and its a mess..'

## Don't hesitate, don't overthink, don't complicate things

'Hey, can I get your number?' 'No, I have a boyfriend' 'Np, thanks.' = Confidence

## Always introduce yourself and ask for their names

'Hey, we haven't met. I'm Jonas, nice to meet you.'

This makes it less awkward when you meet them for a second time, and easily extends your circle of friends.

## Divide and conquer.

Make plans, formulate steps, act on them.

## Take notes, use paper

Something big to decide on? Something complicated, messy? Write it down, get it out of your system.

## Tell you mom you love her

You don't do this as often as you should, and one day its to late

## Don't worry about the future

Act, and things will fall in place.
## Don't worry about the present

Look back three years. What did you worry about back then? Is it still important now?

## Don't worry about the past

You can't change it. Learn from your mistakes, act on them.

## Everyone else also has problems

There is no perfect human

## Perfection doesn't exist

Don't beat up yourself because something didn't work out perfectly.

## Can't decide? Just chose anything. Get out of your heard!

You can always make up your mind and choose a different route.

## It's OK to make mistakes.

Everyone does.

## Learn to dance

## Learn to cook

## It's OK to eat out or order fastfood

## Have options

Meet this group of people or go to that event. It will give you confidence to say no

## You are awesome
